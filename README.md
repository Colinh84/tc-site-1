# Topcoder.com Wordpress site #

## Overview

The [topcoder] site is has several crucial components. The first is Wordpress.
Not only is all content managed through Wordpress, but all new pages are created
through Wordpress and our PHP templates utilize the Wordpress platform in many
ways. The second is the [Topcoder API](http://github.com/topcoderinc/tc-api). Much of our front-end development happens
independent of the API, but we are ultimately dependent on the API as our access
point to our data model. Some of this access happens on the backend, in PHP, but
we are increasingly moving to the frontend. This brings me to the last piece,
and the one that will increasingly be the most important one for development in
this repo. Our legacy code is mostly jQuery, but we are in the process of
rewriting many of our core pages in Angular. In the process, we are moving
templating and routing from the PHP/Wordpress side to the frontend (and
Angular).

Below, we explain some of the nuts and bolts to help new developers get
up-and-running.

## File Organization ##

Try to keep php functions in a purposeful location inside the lib/ directory.

All php templates should call get_header();  If using a custom header be sure that header includes main herder at the to
of the template file using the following code.  See header-challenge.php for an example.

    <?php
    get_template_part('header-main');
    ?>

Please be aware of duplicate code.  The use of templates is a key aspect of Wordpress.  Please see
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_template_part) for more information.

## Javascript and CSS ##

There should be no Javascript or CSS in PHP template files; that is, all
Javascript and CSS should be in separate (and appropriately placed) `*.js` and
`*.css` files. The only acceptable time to include Javascript in a PHP template
is to pull data into a Javascript variable from PHP. You can break up Javascript
and CSS into as many files as is useful for organization without impacting
performance, since we minify and concatenate all our Javascript and CSS files in
production (that said, all your JS (especially Angular code) should be
minification-safe).

...that said, we should probably teach you how to

## add new JS and CSS files ##

Our JS and CSS files are concatenated and minified by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), which is
configured in `Gruntfile.js` in the root of this repo. The `grunt` process pulls
in the file `wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/config/script-register.json` to
determine which files are to be concatenated and minified, as well as what
templates they are to be loaded on.

Each end-product of minification and concatenation is called a "package". Each
package has three properties: `name`, which is a *required* string that should
match the name of the package (i.e., the name of the property used to reference
the package); `js`, which is an array of strings referenced relative to
`wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/js`; and `css`, which is an array referenced 
relative to `wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/css`. After the "packages"
section, there is also a "templates" section that gives a mapping of package
names to PHP templates. This determines which packages will be loaded for which
templates.

While there is much JS and CSS that is more or less site-wide, you should
determine what CSS and JS your package uses and exclude everything else so as to
ensure optimal performance.

#### Example: ####

__Loading home page__:

1. Template used: front.php
2. The script loader will look at script-register.js and see that front.php is not included the "templates" object.
3. Since this page is not in the "templates" object, the page will default to
   using the "default" JS/CSS package. If minification is being used, this means
   `default.min.js` and `default.min.css` will be used; otherwise, all the files
   listed will be loaded individually.

For more information see `lib/scripts.php`

### Minification and the CDN ###

There are new theme options to control JS/CSS optimizations.
The options can be found at `/wp-admin/themes.php?page=options.php`.

* __Use CDN__:  This will change the base url for JS and CSS files to the url entered in the "CDN Base URL" setting.
  If CDN is being used it's assumed that JS/CSS is also minified.

  **Path**: "{$base_path}/{version}/{$type}/{$asset_name}.min.{$type}";

* __Use Minified JS/CSS__: If "Use CDN" is unchecked, this will attempt to use
  minified JS and CSS which is assumed to be in the folder
  `wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/dist`. To build into this folder, simply run
  the `grunt` command with no arguments, and then move the files in `dist/js`
  and `dist/css` into the main `dist` folder. This Grunt script is also
  responsible for minifying and sending to CloudFront when the CDN is used.


## Local Env Setup ##

When working on the site locally there are a few setup steps.

* The domain must be `*.topcoder.com`.
* Your local webserver must be using port 80.
* The data export is kept at https://github.com/topcoderinc/tc-site-data.
  These are updated weekly upon releases to production.
  You can import this data in the site's WP dashboard.
* Add a env.php file to the `wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/config` directory.
  See below for what to put in this file.

## Environmental Variables ##

If you would like to set environment-specific variables or settings, add a file
called `env.php` in the `wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/config` directory.
We recommend the following lines for purposes of local development.

    <?php
    define("WP_SITEURL", "http://local.topcoder.com");
    define("WP_HOME", "http://local.topcoder.com");
    // if you want to change the api url
    define('TC_API_URL', 'https://api.topcoder.com/v2');
    
    force_ssl_admin(false);
    force_ssl_login(false);
    ?>

## Development Guidelines ##

### Code Style ###

These are the formating rules our code should follow.

* Javascript
    * 2 spaces for indention
    * Otherwise follow the google standard:  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml

### AngularJS ###

* There is a sample AngularJS integration with Wordpress on the [angular_service branch](https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/tree/angular_service).
    * Look at the page template page_angular_example (https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/blob/angular_service/wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/page-angular-example.php) for integration into Wordpress page template.

Here are some general rules to follow
* General AngularJS development guidelines can be found on the [AngularJS website](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)
* root angular directory at tcs-responsive/js/app (https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/tree/angular_service/wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/js/app)
Main application file: app.js (https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/blob/angular_service/wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/js/app/app.js)
    * Global level configuration
    * Setup main tc application
* Organize code into logical directories
    * All challenge related code should be under the challenges folder
    * Create new folders as needed (i.e members)
* Separate code into correct folders by type (controllers, services, filters, directives)
* Use directives or templates to hold all html, preferable templates.
* Controllers should be implemented by using the controller function on the main app object (the tc variable).  (https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/blob/angular_service/wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/js/app/challenges/controllers/challengeListingCtrl.js#L3)
* Services, filters and directives should all be their own modules (https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site/blob/angular_service/wp-content/themes/tcs-responsive/js/app/challenges/services/challengeService.js#L3)
* Services should use Restangular (https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)
* Tables should use ngGrid: http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/
* DO NOT MANIPULATE THE DOM WITH JQUERY.  See the [Development Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) for an example directive which manipulates the DOM.
* The use of external libraries is encourged but they must be approved before use.
* Use the Angular Loading Bar while the page is being loaded (http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-loading-bar/)

## Approved AngularJS libraries

* ui-router for Routing: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
* ng-grid for talbes: http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/
* Restangular: https://github.com/mgonto/restangular
* Angular Loading Bar: http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-loading-bar/

## GIT Information ##

### Branch Model ###

To contribute to this repository, you must follow our branch model â€“ *even if* you're contributing from a fork
of the repo. A branch for a given feature takes the name format `<developer name>-<issue or feature ID>-<description>`.
This branch should be off of the tc-site `dev` branch. When you are done committing your changes to this branch,
submit a pull request against our dev branch.

Every Friday (sometimes postponed until Sunday), the `master` branch gets pushed to our QA server at
[http://tcqa1.topcoder.com](http://tcqa1.topcoder.com). If you need to make changes to your code that is
already in QA, you will need to do a pull against the most recent release branch, which will look like
`TC-<date>`. The branch you use for these changes should have the same format as usual, but something like
`-fix` should be appended to the end.

### Challenge Submission and Review ###

Registrants in a challenge should work off GIT.  Challenge submissions should be in the form of a git patch.  We will
follow the [https://drupal.org](Drupal) methodology for patches.  This description of a patch was taken from drupal.org

> Patches are pieces of code that solve an existing issue. In fact, patches describe the changes between a before and
after state of either a module or core. By applying the patch the issue should no longer exist.

There is extensive documentation about how to create and apply patches. There are instructions https://drupal.org/patch

* Submitters should review the documentation on creating a patch:  https://drupal.org/node/707484
* Reviewers should review the documentation on applying a patch:  https://drupal.org/node/1399218

__Final Submissions should be in the form of a pull request.  See the section on Branch Model for more information__

### Recommend Workflow for Working on a Challenge ###

These are some workflows to help you get starting with Git.  Once you become more familiar, you can modify the workflow
to fit your style.

**Working on a challenge**

1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site.git dev`
    * If you already have a repository setup, be sure to pull down the latest changes: `git pull origin master`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
1. Make your changes, add new files, etc.
1. Make commits as you go on your branch
1. If you create new files be sure to add them to git first `git add <file name>`

**Submitting a patch to a challenge**

1. Pull down the latest code: `git fetch origin`
1. Merge in the latest changes from the master branch: `git merge master`
1. Create a patch against the master branch:  `git diff master > patchn_ame.patch`

**Creating a pull request for for final approval**

1. Create a fork of the project on Gitlab if you haven't already. https://gitlab.com/topcoderinc/tc-site
1. Add the new remote to your local git repo.  `git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>` for example
`git remote add mine git@gitlab.com:indytechcook/tc-site.git`.
1. Make sure all of the code is committed to the branch you were working on above.
1. Verify code is ready to be pushed by running `git status`
1. Push code to remote repository. `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>`
